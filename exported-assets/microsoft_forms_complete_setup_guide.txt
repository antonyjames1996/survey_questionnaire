**Follow-up Text Box**:
"If you selected 'Other' or want to improve any response, please provide your enhanced approach:"

## STEP 3: Advanced Features
- **Add branching**: Route teachers to additional questions based on their expertise
- **Set response collection**: Limit to organization members for data quality
- **Enable response summary**: Allow teachers to see anonymized results
- **Add thank you message**: Include timeline for sharing improved AI responses

## STEP 4: Distribution Strategy
- **Share via email**: Send to SEN coordinators and subject leads
- **Embed in platform**: Add to school intranet or learning management system
- **QR code**: Create for easy mobile access during staff meetings
- **Reminder system**: Set up follow-up emails through Power Automate

## STEP 5: Data Collection Best Practices
- **Pilot test**: Run with 3-5 teachers first
- **Collect demographic info**: Teaching experience, SEN specialization, subjects taught
- **Set collection period**: 2-3 weeks for adequate response rate
- **Monitor responses**: Check daily for technical issues or unclear questions

## STEP 6: Response Analysis Setup (Power Automate)
1. Create automated flow: "When a new response is submitted"
2. Get response details from your form
3. Parse responses into categories
4. Store in Excel Online or SharePoint List
5. Send summary emails to research team

## STEP 7: Data Processing for AI Training
After collection:
- Export responses to Excel
- Categorize teacher improvements by intervention type
- Create preference pairs (Original LLM vs Teacher Enhanced)
- Format for RLHF training dataset
- Anonymize all teacher identifiers

## POWER AUTOMATE WORKFLOW TEMPLATE
```
Trigger: When a new response is submitted
├── Get response details
├── Parse JSON responses
├── Create Excel row with structured data
├── Send confirmation email to respondent
└── Notify research team of new response
```

## SAMPLE DATA STRUCTURE FOR ANALYSIS
| ResponseID | TeacherID | ScenarioID | SENCategory | SelectedOption | TeacherImprovement | Confidence | Timestamp |
|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|-----------|
| R001       | T_ANON_01 | S_001      | ADHD        | Environmental   | "Add fidget tools" | High       | 2025-10-28 |

This structure enables both quantitative analysis (which options chosen most) and qualitative analysis (teacher improvements for AI training).
